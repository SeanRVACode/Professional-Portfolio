## Automation Project

This project attempts to automate the dinosaur jump game from google (it doesn't work with chrome://dino instead you must use. https://elgoog.im/dinosaur-game/). It is set up currently for my specific monitor and has varying results. This could be due to the processing power of my computer or the FPS.

To further describe the issue certain elements move too quickly for it to process on the set up this project was coded on. This is evident by the program seeing a cactus in one instance, but missing it in another.
